# "Predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure for Turbofan engine" & "Quality Prediction in a Mining Process"

This repository contains the code and documentation for my six-week internship project with upSkill Campus and IoT Academy under the collaboration of UniCoverage Technology. The project focuses on developing a Machine Learning Model application. 

Turbofan Engine Project: The project focused on predicting the number of remaining operational cycles before failure for a Turbofan engine. Using machine learning techniques, historical sensor data from the engine was analyzed to build a predictive model, aiding in proactive maintenance, and preventing unexpected engine failures.

Mining Process Quality Prediction: In this project, data from a mining process was used to predict the quality of the output. By employing data analysis and machine learning algorithms, the model was able to forecast the quality of the mining process, helping optimize production efficiency and reduce waste.


## Overview

In this internship, I embarked on a journey of exploration, planning, and implementation. I began by familiarizing myself with the problem statement and acquiring essential knowledge about UniCoverage Technology and its initiatives in the digital transformation domain. This included understanding their products and solutions leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and more.

Throughout the six weeks, I meticulously planned and executed my project, which involved Data Analyses, Data Preprocessing, creating Machine Learning model to solve these problem, use hypertuning to enhance model functionality. I also gained insights into industry practices, such as industry 4.0, predictive maintenance, and the benefits of digital twins.

## Features

#### Project Understanding and Data Exploration:
- Understand the problem statement and define the objectives of the projects.
- Explore the datasets for both projects to understand the data structure and the features.
- Analyze the target variable and its distribution to gain insights into the problem.

#### Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.
- Perform feature engineering to extract relevant information from the data.
- Normalize or scale the data to ensure consistent ranges and improve model convergence.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

#### Turbofan Engine Project:
- Implement advanced machine learning algorithms such as neural networks or gradient boosting methods for regression.
- Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the training and testing sets.
- Visualize the predicted vs. actual values to assess model accuracy.

#### Mining Process Project:
- Explore Machine learning models like RandomForestRegressor for regression.
- Fine-tune the RandomForestRegressor model architecture and hyperparameters for optimal results.
